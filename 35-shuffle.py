# If we didn't have the "in place" requirement, we could allocate a new list, 
# then one-by one take a random item from the input list, remove it, put it in 
# the first position in the new list, and keep going until the input list is 
# empty (well, probably a copy of the input listâ€”best not to destroy the input)
# How can we adapt this to be in-place?
# What if we make our new "random" list simply be the front of our input list?
